In order to implement the automatic block of users when they fail 3 or more login attempts
the file application.php of the Joomla core has been modified. So when installing this component 
it is needed to manually install the modified file by executing the command:

$ cp components/<component>/helpers/html/application.php.tobeinstalled \
libraries/joomla/application/application.php

The database shall be modified using the command:

-- 
-- Table structure for table `jos_phd_user_login_control`
-- 

CREATE TABLE `jos_phd_user_login_control` (
  `username` varchar(20) NOT NULL,
  `failed_login_attempts` tinyint(1) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY  (`username`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8;

Update 2014-11-17: The users to be blocked are checked against the table 'jos_phd_users'. Other users performing failed
login attempts will not be blocked.
